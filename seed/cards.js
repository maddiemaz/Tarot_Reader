Passion is fueled by a fear instead of inspiration, and that can lead to jumpy and impulsive decision-making. The King of Wands Reversed warns you of taking people for granted in the pursuit of your goals. Manipulation and intimidation can be used to serve his agenda, with no intention of returning any favors. Expectations are set too high, and you are struggling to live up to these standards. Look at the big picture and see that maintaining Wellnessy relationships is also a part of your vision. Evaluate your goals and what is most important to you.',
